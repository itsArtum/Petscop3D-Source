# Petscop3D-Source
The Petscop3D source code!

Feel free to update or whatever (although if you want to actually contribute to this, you should probably start with modifying the newest-version branch rather than using this master branch, even if the newest version contains bugs).

Make sure to open the .project file with Gamemaker Studio 1.4+

I am not responsible for any gamejacks to come from this!
